I just found these files in my archives. They contain basic C implementations of classical data structures from when I was a student. I'm putting them here in case they can be of intererest to beginning programmers.

The comments in the files are in French, but the code itself (function names, etc.) is in English.

- dsets.[hc] := disjoint sets.
- fifo.[hc]  := simple FIFO queue.
- hash.[hc]  := hash table.
- heap.[hc]  := heap.
- slist.[hc] := simply linked list.
- edge.[hc] and graph.[hc] := graph.
- kruskal.c  := implements the Kruskal algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. Uses most of the data structures.

All the code is under the WTFPL: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING
