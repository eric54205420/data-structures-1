I just found these files in my archives. They contain basic C
implementations of classical data structures from when I was a
student. I'm putting them here in case they can be of intererest to
beginning programmers.

The comments in the files are in French, but the code itself (function
names, etc.) is in English.

All the code is under the WTFPL: http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING
